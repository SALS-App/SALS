# Simple Arma Launcher and Syncer

## Issue and feedback tracker.

You can post your bugs, wanted features and or questions into "[Issues](https://github.com/SALS-App/SALS/issues)" (Only English or German)

## Issue Structure
 - Weight: This determents how important the issue (whether a bug or feature request) is. Ranging from 1 to 25 (lowest is less important, highest most important)
 - Labels: We use a range of Labels. (e.g. "Bug", "Enhancement" or "crucial") These should make it easier to determent in more detail whether an issue is a bug report or a feature request.
 - Milestones: Milestones help the issuer to see in what version his feature request or bug report is being implemented.

## Issue FAQ
 - Q: How can I tell whether someone is working on my issue or not?
<br/>A: Simple. When someone is assigned to your Issue, it's being worked on it.
 - Q: I got a low issue weight, what can I do?
<br/>A: Nothing. Maybe explain your issue or feature request in more detail to terminate misunderstanding.
 - Q:A There's no Milestones defined for my issue, what can I do?
<br/> A: Nothing. This time for real.
